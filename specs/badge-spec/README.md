# OpenAuthCert Badge Specification

- `schema-v1.json` defines the JSON Schema for badges issued by the initiative.
- `public.pem` publishes the Ed25519 public key corresponding to the signing key stored in GitHub Secrets.

Schema changes must preserve backward compatibility or bump the schema version.
