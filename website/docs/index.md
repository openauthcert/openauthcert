# OpenAuthCert

Empowering implementers and relying parties with verifiable assurances that identity products interoperate securely.

<div class="hero-actions">
  <a class="action primary" href="/registry">Browse the badge registry</a>
  <a class="action" href="/verify">Verify a badge</a>
  <a class="action" href="/apply">Apply for certification</a>
</div>

## Why OpenAuthCert exists

- **Open governance.** Vendors, deployers, and relying parties share an independent body to review implementations.
- **Transparent criteria.** Every badge is backed by a signed JSON record and documented evidence.
- **Trustable artifacts.** Badges can be verified offline with the published public key.

## Program pillars

### Registry-first
Badges are stored in this repository so that anyone can audit version history, evidence, and revocation notes. The VitePress site renders everything staticallyâ€”no servers required.

### Practical verification
Use the [verify tool](/verify) to check a badge JSON before trusting it. The registry browser exposes JSON links and evidence so you can quickly validate vendor claims.

### Inclusive participation
OpenAuthCert welcomes new vendors. Follow the [apply guide](/apply) to propose a badge, supply evidence, and monitor review.

## Get involved

- Join the discussion on [GitHub issues](https://github.com/openauthcert/openauthcert/issues).
- Review the [badge specification](/spec) and [governance policy](/governance).
- Share the [trust guidance](/trust) with your customers to embed signed evidence in documentation.
